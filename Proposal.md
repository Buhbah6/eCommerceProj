# Description of the clientele

Anyone who needs furniture (new home owners, people who need to change furniture, moving in/out, etc.)

# Project Goal

In COVID times, many people have been moving out of urban locations to live in more rural areas. With that comes the opportunity to have   larger homes at a better price, allowing for more space for different furniture pieces. That's why we've decided that we want to  create a hub where people can find furniture of any brand, new or used, to ease the experience of purchasing furniture and make it an overall more pleasant shopping adventure.

# Overall idea:

Marketplace for furniture -> Amazon style but exclusively for furniture and home appliances
We can have multiple furniture brands choose to sell their products on the marketplace

## We estimate this will take roughly 120hrs (40 hrs per team member)
